## Sat Sri Akaal

This place is barren lol; I had a profile with various projects, but I kept most of them local, feeling they weren’t good enough to publish. and a few years ago I deleted it :P

I had a PAX archive where I stored my work, but somewhere along the way (probably during my endless distrohopping), I lost it. And, of course I couldn't care to make a backup.

Since then, I’ve been coasting along, flunked academically, and ended up drifting through a mediocre university et al; Recently, I had a wake-up call and I'm trying to turn things around and start building meaningful things again, or just have some portfolio that I can get employed

I'll likely start writing soon aboug; ADHD, Cool Math, lessons from this experience, past projects, aspirations, and anything else that gets me moving.

What I’m Currently Learning
Math & Physics - It's been really sucessful now that I'm actually trying to learn the How and Why and solve problems. Previously I struggled because teaching here was simply ad-hoc methods to solve Test Questions and I fail to grasp things unless I have a rigorous understanding, Unmedicated ADHD bad habits and routine, and difficulty keeping with schoolwork (copying notebooks because god forbid you write notes for yourself) kept me away from reading good books and resources and I got jaded.
Machine Learning – I used to dismiss it (and applied math in general), but some FUD pushed me to take it seriously, and now I find it genuinely fascinating.
Symbolic Systems – Exploring Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and related topics.
Functional Programming – Diving into lambda calculus, the internals of interpreters, and distributed systems.
Compilers & Automata Theory – Studying lexers, parsers, and the theoretical underpinnings of computation.
Actually Getting Stuff Done – Because all of this means nothing without execution.

WML!
